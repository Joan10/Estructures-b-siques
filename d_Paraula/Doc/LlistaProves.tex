The First Roumanian American congregation is an Orthodox Jewish congregation
that for more than years occupied a historic building pictured at Rivington
Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. Those who organized the
congregation in were part of a wave of RomanianJewish immigrants who settled
mostly in this precinct. The building had previously been a church, then a
synagogue, and then a church again. It was transformed into a synagogue for a
second time and extensively remodeled when the First Roumanian-American
congregation purchased it in The synagogue's high ceiling, good acoustics, and
seating for up to 1,800 people made it famous as the Cantor's Carnegie Hall. The
congregation's membership was in the thousands in the 1940s, but by the early
2000s had declined to around 40 as Jews moved out of the Lower East Side. Though
its building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, the
congregation was reluctant to accept outside assistance in maintaining it. In
January 2006, the roof collapsed and the building was demolished two.
